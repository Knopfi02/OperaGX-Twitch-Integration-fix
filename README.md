### Fix the Twitch Sidebar-integration for OperaGX!</br></br></br>

Sometimes OperaGXs Twitch integration is not working/can't be turned on. Here is a potential fix!
The Twitch integration is technically an extention, but you are not able to install it like a normal extention.
You can, however, use the "Developer mode" to import extentions from a folder!

## Try the following steps:

1. <a href="https://github.com/Knopfi02/OperaGX-Twitch-Integration-fix/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a> the zip file of this repository and unpack it
2. Open Opera GX and go to the link `opera://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top left.
4. Press "Load unpacked"
5. Select the unpacked folder called "0.19.0_1"

Hope it helps :D
