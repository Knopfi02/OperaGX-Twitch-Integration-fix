### Fix the Twitch Sidebar-integration for OperaGX!</br></br></br>
(You can also use this to add the sidebar integration if you have normal Opera)

Sometimes OperaGXs Twitch integration is not working/can't be turned on. Here is a potential fix!
The Twitch integration is technically an extention, but you are not able to install it like a normal extention.
You can, however, use the "Developer mode" to import extentions from a folder!
This means, you can get a working version and overwrite the broken one!

## How to :

1. <a href="https://github.com/Knopfi02/OperaGX-Twitch-Integration-fix/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a> the zip file of this repository and unpack it
2. Open Opera GX and go to the link `opera://extensions`. (you can also get to the extention settings by other means)
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked"
5. Select the unpacked folder called "0.22.0_0"

Hope it helps :D
