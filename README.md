### Fix the Twitch Sidebar-integration for OperaGX!</br></br></br>

Sometimes OperaGXs Twitch integration is not working/can't be turned on. Here is a potential fix!
The Twitch integration is technically an extention, but you are not able to install it like a normal extention.
You can, however, use the "Developer Mode" to import extentions from their folder!

## Try the following steps:

1. <a href="https://github.com/Knopfi02/OperaGX-Twitch-Integration-fix/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a> the zip file of this repository and unpack it
2. Open Opera GX and go to the extention settings
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Press "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder called "0.19.0_1"
